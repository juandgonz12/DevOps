Creation of web page for random number generation

Today we created the repository in GitHub where the project will be stored, in this repository we added the members of the group so that everyone has access to the project. In addition, a bucket was created in the Amazon S3 service, where the page will be hosted, thus generating a global deployment. 
The page is developed in HTML, which allows it to be viewed from any browser, thus allowing greater reach among users since it can be accessed from a computer or cell phone. 
In its first version the page was totally static so the number generator did not work properly, however in its second version this error was corrected and its functionality operated correctly. Also we created a file for make some test for the page.
